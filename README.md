# 📚 KG-LLM Research Collection

A curated repository for cutting-edge research on **Knowledge Graphs (KGs)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** synergy. 

This collection systematically organizes fundamental advances and practical implementations across two key paradigms:

🔹 **KG-enhanced LLM** (structured knowledge grounding)

🔹 **LLM-powered KG** (dynamic knowledge acquisition and refinement)
